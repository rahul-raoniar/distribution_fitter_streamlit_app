			### <span style="color:blue">**Purpose of Ditribution Fitter Web Application** üí°</span> 
			Hi! i'm **```Rahul Raoniar```**. I‚Äôm a transportation researcher üß™ and my speciality is pedestrian safety üö∂‚Äç.
			 For that reason, I‚Äôm very fortunate that I get to work with lots of data every day. As a pedestrian safety
			  researcher, I often work with pedestrian crossing speed (average speed maintained by pedestrians while
			   crossing a road) or waiting time at intersections. For this type of continuous data, I often need to identify
			    the best-suited distribution. Last week I started searching open-source libraries for fitting distributions.
			     Even though there are several libraries available for R and Python they are fragmented. Fragmented in
			      the sense that they only support very common distributions.

			   After going through so many libraries and their documentation, I came across the ```Fitter``` library developed 
			   by **```Thomas Cokelaer```**. This library is a ```lifesaver```. It uses ```Scipy``` library in the backend for distribution 
			   fitting and supports ```80 distributions```, which is huge. 

			   After using the fitter library I realized that it 
			   is an underrated library, and students and researchers should know about it. For that reason, I wrote the following blog.

			   Later, I developed this app for making distribution fitting easy and free for everyone.

			   **```I hope everyone benefits from it.```**

			### <span style="color:blue">**About Continuous Distribution Fitter Application**</span>

			   The distribution fitter application will help you compare multiple distributions and 
			   find the best one that fits your data. The application comprised of four sections described as follows:


			#### <span style="color:blue">1. Home</span>
			The home page provides a basic information regarding the application. Additionally, it provides developer information and site
			 related details.

				   Github Page: https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter

			 #### <span style="color:blue">2. Exploratory Data Analysis</span>
			 The ```Exploratory Data Analysis``` section comprised of two subsections, ```Descriptive Stats``` and ```Visualization```.

			 **```1. Descriptive Stats :```** A descriptive statistical analysis part has been added to check the data types and basic
			 statistics to get overall idea about the data.


			 **```2. Visualization :```**
			 Before you start fitting various distributions it is often recommended to plot a histogram, which will help you understand overall
			 distribution your data follows. This will bring down the number of distributions you might need for comparision which
			  eventually save you time.

			 #### <span style="color:blue">3. Distribution Fitting</span>
			  The ```fitter``` class of ```fitter``` library in the backend uses
			  the Scipy library which supports 80 distributions. The Fitter class will scan common distributions or
			  manually selected distributions, call the fit function for you, ignoring those that fail or run forever and finally
			  give you a summary of the best distributions in the sense of sum of the square errors.  

			  In this section two separate distribution fitting methods has been deployed which are described as follows:  

			  **```1. Fit Common Distributions :```** You can select ```Fit Common Distributions``` from the drop down menu which will fit
			    ten common distributions provided by the  ```get_common_distributions( )``` function. The ten common distributions are
			    ```[‚Äòcauchy‚Äô, ‚Äòchi2‚Äô, ‚Äòexpon‚Äô, ‚Äòexponpow‚Äô, ‚Äògamma‚Äô, ‚Äòlognorm‚Äô, ‚Äònorm‚Äô, ‚Äòpowerlaw‚Äô, ‚Äòrayleigh‚Äô, ‚Äòuniform‚Äô].```

			* Once you click ```process```, the application will start fitting all common distributions and return top five distributions' summary in ascending 
			order of the error [distribution with lowest error on top]. By default the distributions are ranked based on 
			```sumsquare_error```. 

			* You can select best distribution parameters by sorting the fitting error based on ```sumsquare_error```, ```aic``` or ```bic```
			criteria


			  **```2. Fit Selected Distributions:```** If you have initial idea about possible distributions that might fit your data
			  then select ```Fit Selected Distributions``` from the drop down menu and select all the distribution that you want to fit.  

			 * Once you click ```process```, the application will start fitting all selected distributions and return top five distributions' summary in ascending 
			order of the error [distribution with lowest error on top]. By default the distributions are ranked based on 
			```sumsquare_error```. 

			* Here also you can select best distribution parameters by sorting the fitting error based on ```sumsquare_error```, ```aic``` or ```bic```
			criteria
